## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-28

The headline change is a substantial CLI overhaul: the `attack` umbrella verb is gone, primitives that duplicated `shell` / `mount` were removed, and three offensive primitives (`escape`, `brute-handle`, `uid-spray`) have been promoted to top-level subcommands. The `export` subcommand was renamed to `convert`. Every subcommand now runs the full check matrix unconditionally — the per-check toggles are gone — and `--help` is grouped into seven sections on every subcommand. The scanner is faster and more resilient against half-open firewalls, and the FUSE driver is now feature-complete.

This is a breaking release. Scripts that called `nfswolf attack ...` or `nfswolf export ...` need updating; see the migration notes inline.

### Added

- New top-level subcommands: `nfswolf escape`, `nfswolf brute-handle`, `nfswolf uid-spray`. Replaces `nfswolf attack escape | brute-handle | uid-spray`.
- New top-level subcommand `nfswolf convert` that renders a JSON dump produced by `nfswolf analyze --json` into HTML / Markdown / CSV / TXT / console. The pipeline is now `analyze --json > results.json` then `convert -i results.json -f html -o report.html`. `convert` is safe to re-run because it does not touch the server.
- Unified positional `<TARGET>` parser shared by every subcommand that touches a single export. Accepts `host`, `host:/export`, or bracketed IPv6 (`[2001:db8::1]:/srv`). `--export` and `--handle` still work as flags; the parser rejects ambiguous combinations with a clear error.
- `--nfs-port` and `--mount-port` are now global flags (previously duplicated on `mount` and `shell`).
- Successful subcommand runs print a `# rerun: nfswolf …` line on stderr that can be pasted back into the shell to reproduce the run. Suppressed by `--quiet` or `--json`.
- `--help` for every subcommand is now grouped into seven sections: Target / Identity / Permissions / Network / Stealth / Output / Behavior.
- Shell: `get -r` and `put -r` recursive directory transfer with `indicatif` per-directory spinners; `get --verify <sha256>` validates the downloaded file against an expected hash.
- Shell: `hostname <name>` command sets `auth_unix.machinename` mid-session to bypass hostname-restricted export ACLs (F-1.4 / F-3.3 precondition probe).
- Shell: SHA-256 of every downloaded file is printed for evidence chains.
- Shell: `--proxy socks5://host:port` tunnels every NFS connection through a SOCKS5 pivot. Inline CONNECT, no external crate.
- Global `--transport-udp` flag for single-shot UDP RPC probes (portmapper amplification measurement, NSM probes). Wiring into the scanner's portmapper queries is tracked as the next step in `tasklist.md`.
- FUSE: every `Nfs3Client` procedure is now wired through a `Filesystem` callback (lookup, getattr, setattr, access, readlink, mknod, mkdir, symlink, create, unlink, rmdir, rename, link, readdir, read, write, fsync, statfs). Auto-UID escalation runs on every callback and caches the resolved credential per inode.
- NFSv4 shell: `nfswolf shell --nfs-version 4` drops into a minimal NFSv4 shell (ls / cd / pwd / cat / get) using `Nfs4DirectClient` — works against NFSv4-only servers where MOUNT and the portmapper are filtered.
- Scanner: `nfs4_reachable: bool` field in `HostResult`, set by a direct NFSv4 COMPOUND PUTROOTFH probe to confirm v4 even when portmapper is filtered (F-3.3).

### Changed

- Scanner: per-host TCP probes for ports 111 and 2049 now run concurrently via `tokio::join!`. A half-open firewall on one port no longer serializes the other.
- Scanner: every portmap / mount RPC call inside `scan_host` (`detect_nfs_versions`, `list_exports`, `mount`, `dump_clients`, `detect_nis`) is wrapped in `tokio::time::timeout(probe_timeout, …)`. A stateful firewall that completes the TCP handshake on 111 but drops RPC payload can no longer stall a worker for the underlying client default.
- Scanner: per-host workers are panic-isolated. A single misbehaving target can no longer sink a multi-thousand-host sweep.
- `nfswolf mount(1)` now detaches into a daemon so the FUSE handler outlives the shell.
- `analyze`: every analysis now runs the full check matrix unconditionally. The only per-run knobs are `--test-read PATH`, `--test-read-uids`, `--test-read-gids`, and `--v4-depth`. `--test-read` defaults to `/etc/shadow` when no paths are supplied.
- `analyze`: dropped per-check toggles (`-A/--check-all`, `--skip-version-check`, `--no-exploit`, `--check-v4`, `--check-no-root-squash`, `--check-insecure-port`, `--check-nohide`, `--check-v2-downgrade`, `--check-portmap-amplification`, `--check-nis`, `--probe-squash`).
- `analyze`: dropped `--output FILE` / `--txt FILE`. The global `--json` flag now makes `analyze` emit a JSON array on stdout — capture with shell redirection and feed to `nfswolf convert`.
- `scan`: dropped per-check toggles (`--fast`, `--no-rpc-enum`, `--check-portmap-amplification`, `--check-v2-downgrade`, `--check-nis`, `--check-portmap-bypass`). Every scan now runs the full check matrix unconditionally. The only knobs are concurrency, ports, and timeout.
- `mount`: dropped `--auto-uid`, `--allow-root`, `--suid`, `--dev`, `--allow-other`, `--elevate-perms`. The credential ladder, owner-bit elevation, suid/dev passthrough, and shared-mount visibility are always on — this is a security toolkit, the goal is unobstructed access. `-e` short for `--export` was added.
- `shell`: dropped `--auto-uid`. The credential ladder is always on; the shell falls through to escalated credentials on every `NFS3ERR_ACCES`.
- `--export` consistently has `-e` as its short form on every subcommand that accepts it.

### Removed

- The `attack` parent verb is gone.
- Removed `attack read`, `attack write`, `attack upload`, `attack harvest`, and `attack symlink-swap`. `shell` (`get`, `put`, `get -r`, `put -r`, `cat`, `find`) and `mount` (regular filesystem tools) cover the same primitives with the same credential ladder.
- Removed `attack lock-dos` entirely. Lock-storm DoS was the only NLM-dependent feature; with it gone, the NLM and NSM clients (`src/proto/nlm/`, `src/proto/nsm/`), the F-6.1 NLM lock-attack analyzer check, and the portmapper helpers `detect_nlm` / `detect_nsm` are removed. F-6.2 / F-6.3 (grace-period DoS, SETCLIENTID state destruction) were never implemented and are documented as out of scope.
- Removed `attack v4-grace` (placeholder-only; no working implementation).
- Removed `src/engine/fs_walker.rs` (recursive walker used only by `harvest`) and the `CredentialManager` struct from `src/engine/credential.rs` (used only by removed attack modules). The `escalation_list` helper survives — it is shared by `shell`, `mount`, and the three offensive subcommands.
- Removed inline `--escape` flag from offensive subcommands. To cross the export boundary, run `nfswolf escape` first and feed the resulting handle into `shell --handle HEX` or `mount --handle HEX`. The escape module is now the single entry point for export breakout.

### Fixed

- FUSE: `--elevate-perms` shift offset (now correctly copies owner bits to other; previously copied group bits, leaving 0700 unchanged). Behavior is now always-on.
- FUSE: `--nfs-port` being silently ignored when `--export` was used (was only honored with `--handle`).
- FUSE: `--proxy` not being passed to the connection pool, so `--handle` mounts now tunnel through SOCKS5.
- FUSE: server-side symlink resolution and the null-attr READDIRPLUS fix-up are always on (NetApp / nested-export workaround).
- Multiple small CLI bugs surfaced by live-server testing.

### Migration

- `nfswolf attack escape ...`        → `nfswolf escape ...`
- `nfswolf attack brute-handle ...`  → `nfswolf brute-handle ...`
- `nfswolf attack uid-spray ...`     → `nfswolf uid-spray ...`
- `nfswolf attack read ...`          → `nfswolf shell ... -c "cat <path>"` (or `get`)
- `nfswolf attack write ...`         → `nfswolf shell ... -c "put <path>"` (with `--allow-write`)
- `nfswolf attack upload ...`        → `nfswolf shell ... -c "put -r <dir>"`
- `nfswolf attack harvest ...`       → `nfswolf shell ... -c "find /"` then `cat`
- `nfswolf attack symlink-swap ...`  → `nfswolf shell ... -c "symlink ..."`
- `nfswolf attack lock-dos ...`      → no replacement; out of scope
- `nfswolf attack v4-grace ...`      → no replacement; out of scope
- `nfswolf export -i results.json -f html` → `nfswolf convert -i results.json -f html`
- `nfswolf analyze --output report.html`   → `nfswolf analyze --json > results.json && nfswolf convert -i results.json -f html -o report.html`

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-17

First public release. Covers the full NFS attack path: recon → enumeration → analysis → exploitation → shell. For authorized security research only.

### Protocol support

- NFSv2, NFSv3, and NFSv4.0 over TCP with full XDR encoding
- AUTH_SYS credential injection with per-call stamp rotation to avoid duplicate-request-cache hits
- MOUNT, portmapper (DUMP / GETPORT), NLM4 lock procedures, and NSM stat/monitor
- NFSv4 COMPOUND operations: PUTROOTFH, GETFH, LOOKUP, GETATTR, READDIR, READ, SECINFO
- UDP transport for single-shot RPC probes (portmapper amplification measurement)
- SOCKS5 proxy support for all TCP connections
- Connection pool with per-(host, export, uid, gid) bucketing, LIFO reuse, and health eviction
- Circuit breaker with sliding-window failure tracking and exponential-backoff cooldown; permission denials do not trip the breaker during UID spraying

### Subcommands

- **scan** — concurrent host and export enumeration across configurable CIDR ranges; detects NFSv2/v3/v4, supported auth flavors, and open portmapper/NLM/NSM services
- **analyze** — automated security analysis against all 36 findings (F-1.1 through F-7.6); produces a risk-scored report
- **shell** — interactive NFS shell with 35 commands, tab completion, and readline history; supports `get`/`put` with recursive (`-r`) directory transfer and SHA-256 verification; `hostname` spoofing to bypass hostname-restricted exports
- **mount** — FUSE filesystem mount with spoofed AUTH_SYS credentials; exposes the remote export as a local directory
- **export** — renders a prior analysis result in any of six output formats
- **attack** — nine targeted attack modules:
  - `uid-spray` — brute-force UID/GID pairs using the ACCESS oracle
  - `escape` — construct file-handle escape payloads for ext4, XFS, and BTRFS
  - `read` — read arbitrary files by inode using forged handles
  - `write` — write files as any UID without `no_root_squash` mitigation
  - `harvest` — recursive secret pattern matching across an export tree
  - `brute-handle` — inode-range handle brute-force with STALE/BADHANDLE oracle discrimination
  - `lock-dos` — NLM4 lock-storm denial-of-service
  - `symlink-swap` — TOCTOU symlink substitution attack
  - `v4-grace` — NFSv4 grace-period state disruption

### Security analysis

- 36 findings across seven categories: credential spoofing (F-1.x), export escape (F-2.x), network (F-3.x), privilege escalation (F-4.x), enumeration (F-5.x), locking (F-6.x), and policy misconfiguration (F-7.x)
- Every finding references the authoritative RFC section and includes severity, detection method, and a detailed write-up
- Auto-UID resolution: nine-step strategy that tries NFSv2 (no root_squash negotiation), NFSv3 ACCESS oracle, and UID 0/65534/1000 before falling back to spray

### File handle engine

- OS and filesystem fingerprinting from handle structure (Linux ext4, XFS, BTRFS, Windows, FreeBSD)
- Escape handle construction targeting inode 2 (ext4 root), XFS inode 128, and BTRFS subvolume UUID layouts
- BTRFS compound-UUID escape with subvolume enumeration
- Windows handle signing detection (HMAC presence / absence)
- Shannon entropy analysis for handle classification

### Output and reporting

- Six report formats: ANSI-colored console, HTML (self-contained), JSON, CSV, Markdown, plain text
- Risk scoring: weighted sum across finding severities
- `--output` flag on `export` selects format; all formats accept the same `AnalysisResult` input

### Releases

- Pre-built binaries for Linux x86\_64 (musl static, glibc+FUSE), Linux arm64 (musl static, glibc+FUSE), Windows x86\_64 (MSVC, GNU), Windows arm64 (MSVC), macOS arm64, macOS x86\_64, and macOS universal
- `SHA256SUMS` file with cosign keyless signature (`SHA256SUMS.sig`) for every release
- SLSA build provenance attestations for every binary via `actions/attest-build-provenance`
